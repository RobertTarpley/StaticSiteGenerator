## What the heck is a Static Site Generator?

It's a great way to create a website without having to write HTML or CSS from scratch. 

It's also a great way to create a website that is fast, secure, and easy to maintain.

## How does it work? 

Content is written in Markdown, which is then converted to HTML by the static site generator. 

The static site generator also takes care of generating the navigation, footer, and other common elements of a website.
