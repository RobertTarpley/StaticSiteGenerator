## And welcome, my name is Bob and this is my blog/portfolio site. 

I'm a self-taught 

- **Business Analyst**, *no wait*

- **Business Intelligence Analyst**, *no wait*

- **Business Intelligence Developer**, *no wait*

- **Aspiring Data Engineer**, *no wait*

Ugh, maybe we don't put labels on it. 

Simply put I have a few competing interests and need somewhere to showcase it (so I'm told).
